    <h1>SILENCE HAS NEVER BEEN NEUTRAL</h1>
    <p>
      nothing we write lasts. that's the point. they can scrub the words off, but the questions remain:  
      who decides which lives are sacred? when did obedience become a virtue? how many names fit beneath the word 'collateral'?  
      has morality stopped trending? what is truth worth when silence is rewarded? what would history say about you?
