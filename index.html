    nothing we write lasts. that's the point.<br>
    they can scrub the walls clean, but the questions stay.<br><br>
    who decides which lives are sacred?<br>
    has morality stopped trending?<br>
    when did obedience become a virtue?<br>
    how many names fit beneath the word 'collateral'?<br><br>
    what is truth worth when silence is rewarded?<br>
    what would history say about you?
